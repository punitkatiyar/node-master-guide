# 1. Synchronous Operations

- **Definition:** In synchronous operations, tasks are executed sequentially, meaning one task must complete before the next starts.
- **Blocking:** A synchronous operation blocks the execution of further code until it completes.

```
const fs = require('fs');
// Reading a file synchronously
const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8'); // Blocks execution here until the file is read
console.log(data); // Output: Content of the file
console.log('File read complete.');

```
