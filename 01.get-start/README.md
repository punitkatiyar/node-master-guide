## 2. Learn Node.js Core Concepts

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side to build scalable and fast applications.

### Core Topics to Master:
#### 1. Node.js Basics
- Installing Node.js and Using Node REPL
- Running JavaScript Files with node
- The Node.js Event Loop
- Global Objects (__dirname, __filename, process)
- Understanding require() and ES Modules

#### 2. File System (fs) Module
- Reading and Writing Files (Sync vs. Async)
- Creating, Deleting, and Renaming Files
- Working with Directories

#### 3. Event-Driven Programming
- The events Module
- Creating and Listening to Events

#### 4. HTTP Module
- Creating a Simple HTTP Server
- Handling HTTP Requests and Responses
- Working with Query Parameters and POST Data

#### 5. Streams and Buffers
- What are Streams? (Readable, Writable, Duplex)
- Piping Streams (e.g., Reading a File and Sending It as a Response)
- Buffers and Binary Data

#### 6. Path and OS Modules
- Manipulating File Paths (path Module)
- Accessing System Information (os Module)

#### 7. Process Management
- Understanding process.argv for CLI Arguments
- Managing Environment Variables (process.env)

  

<!--
- **Node.js LTS Releases:** The Node.js project has a Long Term Support (LTS) release schedule where new features are added to the project every six months, and every second release is designated as an LTS release. The LTS release is supported for 30 months from the date of its release. The current LTS release as of my knowledge cutoff date is Node.js 16.x.

- **Performance Improvements:** The Node.js team continues to focus on improving performance by optimizing the V8 JavaScript engine, optimizing network I/O, and reducing memory usage.

- **Stability:** The Node.js team also focuses on improving stability by fixing bugs and ensuring compatibility across different platforms.

- **Improved Tooling:** The Node.js team is working on improving the development experience for Node.js developers by providing better tooling and developer experience.

- **Security:** The Node.js team prioritizes security and continues to improve security features such as TLS support, HTTP headers, and authentication.

- **ES Modules:** The Node.js team is working on improving support for ECMAScript modules, which is a feature that allows developers to use the import/export syntax to load and export modules.

- **WebAssembly:** The Node.js team is exploring ways to improve performance by integrating with WebAssembly, which is a low-level binary format that can be executed in modern web browsers.

- **Better Support for Microservices:** Node.js is often used in microservice architectures, and the Node.js team is working on providing better support for microservices by improving the performance of the underlying infrastructure
