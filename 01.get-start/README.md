# Node JS Introduction

- **Node.js LTS Releases: The Node.js project has a Long Term Support (LTS) release schedule where new features are added to the project every six months, and every second release is designated as an LTS release. The LTS release is supported for 30 months from the date of its release. The current LTS release as of my knowledge cutoff date is Node.js 16.x.**

- **Performance Improvements: The Node.js team continues to focus on improving performance by optimizing the V8 JavaScript engine, optimizing network I/O, and reducing memory usage.**

- **Stability: The Node.js team also focuses on improving stability by fixing bugs and ensuring compatibility across different platforms.**

- **Improved Tooling: The Node.js team is working on improving the development experience for Node.js developers by providing better tooling and developer experience.**

- **Security: The Node.js team prioritizes security and continues to improve security features such as TLS support, HTTP headers, and authentication.**

- **ES Modules: The Node.js team is working on improving support for ECMAScript modules, which is a feature that allows developers to use the import/export syntax to load and export modules.**

- **WebAssembly: The Node.js team is exploring ways to improve performance by integrating with WebAssembly, which is a low-level binary format that can be executed in modern web browsers.**

- **Better Support for Microservices: Node.js is often used in microservice architectures, and the Node.js team is working on providing better support for microservices by improving the performance of the underlying infrastructure.**
