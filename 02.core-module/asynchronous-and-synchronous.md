# 1. Synchronous Operations

- **Definition:** In synchronous operations, tasks are executed sequentially, meaning one task must complete before the next starts.
- **Blocking:** A synchronous operation blocks the execution of further code until it completes.

```
const fs = require('fs');
// Reading a file synchronously
const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8'); // Blocks execution here until the file is read
console.log(data); // Output: Content of the file
console.log('File read complete.');

```

# 2. Asynchronous Operations

- **Definition:** In asynchronous operations, tasks are initiated, and the program does not wait for them to complete before moving on to the next task.
- **Non-blocking:** Asynchronous operations do not block the execution of the code.

```
const fs = require('fs');
// Reading a file asynchronously
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data); // Output: Content of the file
});
console.log('File read initiated.');
```

## Example: Synchronous vs Asynchronous
**Imagine you're at a coffee shop:**

- Synchronous: You place your order, and the barista makes your coffee while you wait at the counter. No one else is served until your coffee is done.
- Asynchronous: You place your order, and the barista starts making your coffee while taking orders from other customers. When your coffee is ready, it's handed to you.
