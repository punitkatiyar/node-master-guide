# ðŸ¥‡ Node Js Master Guide  

**Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable, high-performance applications. It was created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl and has since become a popular platform for building server-side applications and network applications.**

**Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine used by the Google Chrome browser. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and lightweight. This allows developers to build applications that can handle a large number of concurrent connections with minimal overhead.**
